# Paillier Encryption
The Paillier cryptosystem, invented by and named after Pascal Paillier in 1999, is a probabilistic asymmetric algorithm for public key cryptography. The problem of computing n-th residue classes is believed to be computationally difficult. The decisional composite residuosity assumption is the intractability hypothesis upon which this cryptosystem is based.

The scheme is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem; this means that, given only the public key and the encryption of {\displaystyle m_{1}}m_{1} and {\displaystyle m_{2}}m_{2}, one can compute the encryption of {\displaystyle m_{1}+m_{2}}m_{1}+m_{2}.
